# Codesticker for Java

Codestickers is a collection of Java annotations to document sections of code.

## Why Codestickers
This library is inspired by the guava annotation VisibleForTesting, which is an excellent
way to mark sections of code or add documentation through code annotations.

I wanted to use the annotation without adding an extensive lib like guava.
