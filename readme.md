# Codesticker for Java [![Build](https://github.com/codestickers/codestickers-java/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codestickers/codestickers-java/actions) [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.codestickers/codestickers.svg)](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccodestickers) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

Codestickers is a collection of Java annotations to document sections of code.

## Why Codestickers
This library is inspired by the guava annotation VisibleForTesting, which is an excellent
way to mark sections of code or add documentation through code annotations.

I wanted to use the annotation without adding an extensive lib like guava.

## How to Use

### Maven
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.codestickers</groupId>
